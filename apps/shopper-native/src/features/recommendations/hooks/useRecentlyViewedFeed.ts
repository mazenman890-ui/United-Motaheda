/**
 * useRecentlyViewedFeed — derived shape suitable for any product carousel.
 *
 * Reads from the MMKV-backed recentlyViewedStore (slice 2) and shapes each
 * entry into a NativeProduct-ish object so it can drop straight into a
 * ProductCard / ProductGrid without a separate component path.
 *
 * Missing fields (stock, category, code, etc.) are filled with safe
 * defaults — the card treats them as "unknown / available". For the full
 * product detail, callers navigate to /product/[id] which fetches the
 * authoritative row via useProduct.
