/**
 * useSplashSequence — deterministic launch state machine.
 *
 * Owns the *logic* of the splash journey so the overlay component only renders.
 * The sequence is a strict, gated machine — a phase never begins before its
 * entry condition is met, so behaviour is identical on every device regardless
 * of how fast the video decodes:
 *
 *   brand ──(minBrandMs elapsed AND video loaded)──▶ video
 *     │                                                │
 *     │ (video never loads by loadTimeoutMs)           │ (didJustFinish / skip / error)
 *     └───────────────────────────────────────────────┴──▶ exiting ──(exitMs)──▶ done
 *
 * Guarantees:
 *   • The brand moment is ALWAYS seen (minBrandMs floor) — never skipped on fast
 *     devices, never dependent on decode speed.
 *   • The video ALWAYS starts from frame 0 (caller binds `videoShouldPlay` to the
 *     player's shouldPlay, with positionMillis 0) — never mid-stream.
 *   • The overlay can NEVER get stuck: a load timeout skips a broken video, and a
 *     safety timeout force-exits if the player's didJustFinish never arrives
 *     (a known expo-av Android OEM bug).
 *
 * All timing is injected, so the values live with the visual constants in the
 * component and the machine stays pure and unit-reviewable.
